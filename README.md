# DFRNet: Deep Face Recognition Network for Large-Scale Identity Recognition

This is the **official implementation** of **DFRNet**, a scalable and robust deep learning framework for large-scale face recognition, built upon state-of-the-art methods including **PartialFC**, **AdaFace**, and **ElasticFace**.

## üî• Related Works and Foundations

Our approach leverages and integrates the strengths of several key methods:

- [Killing Two Birds With One Stone: Efficient and Robust Training of Face Recognition CNNs by Partial FC (CVPR-2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15565)
- [AdaFace: Quality Adaptive Margin for Face Recognition (CVPR-2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00964)
- [ElasticFace: Elastic Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09416.pdf)

We modified and extended **PartialFC** to support both **AdaFace** and **ElasticFace** under both **single-machine** and **distributed training environments** for efficient large-scale training.
